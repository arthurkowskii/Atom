# Neon Dreams EP

A nostalgic journey through synthetic soundscapes and retro-futuristic rhythms.

## Tracklist

1. **Midnight Drive** - Upbeat synthwave with driving bass
2. **Digital Rain** - Ambient downtempo with processed vocals  
3. **Chrome Hearts** - Melodic arpeggios over steady pulse
4. **Dawn Protocol** - Atmospheric closer with pad layers

## Production Philosophy

Each track explores the intersection of digital precision and analog warmth, using hardware-modeled plugins to capture vintage synthesizer character while maintaining modern clarity.
