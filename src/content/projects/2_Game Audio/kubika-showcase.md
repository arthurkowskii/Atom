# Kubika: A Cube Story

Mind-bending, gravity-shifting 3D Sokoban puzzle game featuring innovative spatial audio that adapts to gravity changes and immersive 3D positional sound systems.

## Project Overview

Created immersive spatial audio for this award-winning puzzle game, developing custom systems that respond dynamically to the game's unique gravity-shifting mechanics. The audio design maintains spatial relationships regardless of world orientation, creating a truly three-dimensional soundscape.

## Technical Achievements

- **Gravity-Responsive Audio**: Custom 3D audio listener system
- **Performance Optimization**: Audio pooling and LOD systems  
- **Adaptive Music System**: Parametric system with vertical remixing
- **45+ Sound Effects**: Complete audio library
- **8 Audio Layers**: Dynamic music composition

## Recognition

- 5.0/5 star rating with specific praise for innovative audio design
- Featured as case study for 3D audio in indie game development
- Audio systems reused in team's subsequent projects
- Enhanced the "headphones recommended" meditative experience
