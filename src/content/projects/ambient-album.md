# Ambient Soundscapes

A collection of ambient compositions that blend organic field recordings with synthesized textures.

## Concept

Each track represents a different temporal and spatial environment, from microscopic cellular activity to vast cosmic phenomena.

## Production Notes

- Recorded with vintage microphones in natural environments
- Layered synthesis using modular techniques
- Mixed in surround sound for immersive listening
