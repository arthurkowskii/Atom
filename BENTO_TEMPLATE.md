- Defaults to `bento.accentColor` if not provided.

# Your Project Title

Your full project description and content goes here. This content appears 
when someone visits the direct project URL (`/projects/your-project`).

You can use markdown formatting, add images, code blocks, etc.

## Features

- List your key features
- Highlight main accomplishments
- Include technical details

## Technology Stack

The tech array above will be displayed as pills in the bento layout, 
but you can also elaborate here.

```

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Copy the Template
- Copy the template above to a new `.md` file
- Place it in the appropriate domain folder: `src/content/projects/[order]_[Domain]/your-project.md`

### 2. Customize Content
- **Title & Description**: Update with your project details
- **Tech Stack**: List all technologies used
- **Accent Color**: Choose a color that matches your project's branding
- **Assets**: Add your images to the same folder or Assets subfolder

### 3. Card Configuration
- **Toggle Cards**: Set any card to `false` to hide it
- **Stats**: Customize metrics that best represent your project
- **Process**: Adjust steps to match your development workflow
- **Gallery**: Add project screenshots and images
- **Challenges**: Highlight technical problems you solved
- **Results**: Show the impact and outcomes

### 4. Color Themes
Popular accent color suggestions:
- `#ff6b00` - Orange (energetic, creative)
- `#007bff` - Blue (professional, tech)
- `#28a745` - Green (growth, success)
- `#dc3545` - Red (bold, attention-grabbing)
- `#6f42c1` - Purple (innovative, creative)
- `#fd7e14` - Amber (warm, approachable)

### 5. Asset Organization
Recommended folder structure:
```
src/content/projects/3_YourDomain/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ your-project.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Assets_YourProject/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hero.jpg        # reserved filename for hero background
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logo.png        # reserved filename for hero logo
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ screenshot-1.jpg
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ screenshot-2.jpg
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ screenshot-3.jpg
```

### 6. Test Your Project
- Enable `useBentoLayout: true`
- Visit `http://localhost:4321/projects/your-project` to see the full page
- Test the overlay by clicking the project from the atom view
- Check responsive behavior on different screen sizes

### 7. Assets Folder Pattern (auto gallery)

To simplify image management, you can let the Bento template auto-build the hero and gallery from a single folder.

Frontmatter:

```
useBentoLayout: true
bento:
  assetsFolder: "/src/content/projects/3_YourDomain/Assets_YourProject"
  hero:
    subtitle: "Project Category or Type"
  gallery:
    title: "Gallery"
```

Rules:
- The template scans `assetsFolder` and includes all images (jpg/jpeg/png/webp/gif) in the gallery.
- Files named `hero.*` and `logo.*` are reserved for the hero background and logo and are excluded from the gallery.
- Matching is case-insensitive on the base name (e.g., `Logo.PNG` works).
- If you set `bento.hero.backgroundImage` or `bento.hero.logo`, those explicit values override auto-detected files.

## Tips

- **Hero Image**: Use high-quality, wide images (1400x400px recommended)
- **Gallery**: First image becomes the hero, others become thumbnails
- **Stats**: Keep values short and impactful
- **Process**: 3-5 steps work best for readability
- **Results**: Use descriptive emojis that relate to your achievements

The bento layout automatically adapts to different screen sizes and maintains 
the visual hierarchy across all devices.
