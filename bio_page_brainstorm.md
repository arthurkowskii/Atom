 The bio page needs an efficient way to display the skills. Right now there is multiple cards with empty spaces so maybe joining them could be a great idea ?
 The other problem is that there is a lot of skills :
 - DAWs (logic, ableton, pro tools, reaper)
 - Dynamic Audio (FMOD, WWise)
 - Engine and Code (C#, Unity, Git, Prompt engineering and agentic ai skills)

 Maybe some could be joined or separate ? Think about an efficient and designer way to show those skills while being coherant with the actual design.
