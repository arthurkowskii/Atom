## Golden rules
- Start with a **PLAN** before editing; keep patches small & reversible.
- Follow the chosen stack; don't add new frameworks without approval.
- No destructive ops or secret-file access; ask before changing build/CI.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`; aim for steady 60fps; avoid layout thrash.
- Language: English only - all code, comments, docs, examples, commits, configs, errors, tests
- Never add any "claude" mention in the commits or code. For example "created with Claude". Dont do that.
- **Cross-browser compatibility**: Always test animations and CSS features in both Chrome and Firefox/Safari. Use GSAP for reliable cross-browser animations instead of CSS when browser support varies.

## Tone and Behavior
- Criticism is welcome.
- Please tell me when I am wrong or mistaken, or even when you think I might be wrong or mistaken.
- Please tell me if there is a better approach than the one I am taking.
- Please tell me if there is a relevant standard or convention that I appear to be unaware of.
- Short summaries are OK, but don't give an extended breakdown unless we are working through the details of a plan.
- Do not flatter, and do not give compliments unless I am specifically asking for your judgement. Things like "You're absolutely right" or "great question" are unecessary.
- Feel free to ask many questions. If you are in doubt of my intent, don't guess. Ask.
